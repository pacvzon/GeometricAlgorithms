GeometricAlgorithms
===================

Experimentation project for Geometric Algorithms course at TU/e

In this project you experimentally evaluate algorithms for computing the trapezoidal map of a simple polygon. Thus, in contrast to Project A, all algorithms compute the same data structure, and you want to experimentally compare the running times of the algorithms. You should implement three algorithms. One of the algorithms that you implement should be the standard randomized incremental construction, and one of the others should use a different paradigm (sweep-line or divide&conquer). One algorithm should run in o(n log n) time, where n is the number of vertices of the simple polygon (we will discuss such an algorithm in a lecture or in the homework). Note that not all of your algorithms need to handle all degenerate cases, but you should discuss, which cases they handle.
